# calendar-journal-web

Marketing site for Calendar Journal built with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind (shadcn/ui components).

## Local Development

Install deps (using bun, npm or pnpm) and run dev server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Build

```bash
bun run build
```

Output is in `dist/`.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This repo is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages (project site) under the path `/calendar-journal-web/`.

Changes introduced:

- `vite.config.ts` sets default `base: '/calendar-journal-web/'` but you can override with env var `VITE_GH_PAGES_BASE` (ensure trailing slash)
- `BrowserRouter` in `src/App.tsx` uses `basename="/calendar-journal-web"`
- `public/404.html` handles deep-link refreshes on GitHub Pages for SPA routing

### Steps
1. Commit and push changes to `main`.
2. Create a GitHub Actions workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that runs `bun install` (or npm), `bun run build`, and deploys `dist` to the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings: Source = `gh-pages` branch, root `/`.

### Custom Domain
If you later use a custom domain with a `CNAME`, set `base: '/'` in `vite.config.ts` and remove the `basename` prop from `BrowserRouter`.
