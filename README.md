# calendar-journal-web

Marketing site for Calendar Journal built with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind (shadcn/ui components).

## Local Development

Install deps (using bun, npm or pnpm) and run dev server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Build

```bash
bun run build
```

Output is in `dist/`.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages User Site)

Repo renamed to `marvin-brt.github.io` so the site is served from root `https://marvin-brt.github.io/`.

Key points:
- `vite.config.ts` uses `base: '/'`.
- Router uses plain `<BrowserRouter>` (no basename).
- `public/404.html` redirects deep links to `/index.html?redirect=...` and `RedirectHandler` restores the path.

Redeploy: push to `main` and the GitHub Actions workflow builds & publishes.
